Coding style is based on the K&R style.  It was reformatted with clang-format
LLVM, with some changes to remove special cases for consistency and
simplicity:

* Line width is set to 128 characters, since no one has seen a Wyse 60 is a very long time.
* Standard indentation is used namespaces

For emacs users, this is set automatically from `.dir.locals.el`.

The `clang-format` program was used  '.clang-format' as a configuration.

Other conventions:
  - member variables: begin with _
  - never use "using namespace" in a header file
