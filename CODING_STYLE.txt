Coding style is based on the google C++ style.  With some changes
to remove special cases for consistency and simplicity:

* Line width is set to 128 characters, since no one has seen a Wyse 60 is a very long time.
* Single line functions in headers are not formatted in special way.
* Standard indentation is used namespaces

For emacs users, this is set automatically from `.dir.locals.el`.
The `google-c-style` package should be installed from the package archive.

The `clang-format` program was used  '.clang-format'
